# Breast Cancer Detection - ML model Using Logistic Regression

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying breast cancer using a Logistic Regression model with the Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) dataset. The FNA dataset is widely used in medical machine learning for diagnosing breast cancer by analyzing cytological features collected from fine needle aspirates.

## Tech Stack

- Programming Language: Python
- Google Colab
- Data Handling & Preprocessing: Pandas and NumPy
- Machine Learning Model: Scikit-Learn


## Features

- The model predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign, utilizing logistic regression, a probabilistic algorithm suited for binary classification problems.
- Involves selecting the most influential features from the dataset (e.g., mean radius, texture, perimeter, and area), which contribute significantly to model performance.
- The logistic regression model achieved the following accuracy metrics:
    - Training Data Accuracy: 94.73%
    - Test Data Accuracy: 92.98%


## Learning Goals

- Understand Logistic Regression and its application to binary classification.
- Gain proficiency in preprocessing and feature engineering with FNA dataset.
- Learn to evaluate model performance using accuracy
